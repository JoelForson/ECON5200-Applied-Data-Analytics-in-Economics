# Economic Data Science Portfolio

## ECON 5200: Applied Data Analytics in Economics

---

## Welcome!

I'm an undergraduate economics student passionate about leveraging data science to solve real-world economic problems. This repository showcases my journey in **Applied Data Analytics**, where I'm learning to bridge the gap between traditional economic theory and cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

I'm actively seeking opportunities in **Data Analysis**, **Data Science**, and **Machine Learning Engineering**, where I can apply rigorous economic thinking alongside modern computational methods.

## About This Portfolio

This repository contains coursework, labs, and projects from ECON 5200, where I explore the intersection of **causal inference** and **predictive analytics**. 

### Course Philosophy: Concept Extension

Rather than treating statistics and machine learning as separate disciplines, this course takes a unique **"Concept Extension"** approach:

- **Start with foundational concepts**: Classical statistical methods (e.g., OLS regression, hypothesis testing)
- **Scale up with ML**: Extend these concepts using modern algorithms (e.g., Lasso, Ridge, Random Forests)
- **Bridge theory and practice**: Connect economic intuition with computational power

Through this approach, I'm developing the ability to:

- Apply causal inference techniques to understand economic relationships
- Build predictive models for forecasting and pattern recognition
- Translate economic questions into data science solutions
- Critically evaluate when to use traditional econometrics vs. machine learning
